    "# **Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    " It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and classes to create programs.\n",
    " \n",
    "  An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  These variables are often referred to as properties of the object, and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program. Main principles of OOPs in Python are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Class\n",
    "\n",
    "  A class is a collection of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  class class_name:\n",
    "    class body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a new class with the keyword “class” following the class_name and colon. And we consider everything you write under this after using indentation as its body. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **Objects and Object Instantiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a class, only the description or a blueprint of the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    " There is no memory allocation until we create its object. The objector instance contains real data or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation is nothing but creating a new object/instance of a class\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj1 = Car()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Class Constructor**\n",
    "\n",
    " The job of the class constructor is to assign the values to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the properties of the car or any other object must be inside a method that we call __init__( ). \n",
    "\n",
    "This __init__() method is also known as the **constructor method**. We call a constructor method whenever an object of the class is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the __init__() method. So, the first parameter of this method has to be self. Then only will the rest of the parameters come.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two statements inside the constructor method are –\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.name_f = name\n",
    "self.color5= color:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create new attributes, namely name and color, and then assign the value of the respective parameters to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **“self”** keyword represents the instance of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "By using the “self” keyword, we can access the attributes and methods of the class. It is useful in method definitions and in variable initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    " The “self” is explicitly used every time we define a method.\n",
    "\n",
    " You can also create attributes **outside** of this __init__() method. \n",
    " \n",
    " But those attributes will be universal to the whole class, and you will have to assign a value to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " class Car:\n",
    "    car_type = \"Sedan\"                 #class attribute\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, color):\n",
    "        self.name = name               #instance attribute   \n",
    "        self.color = color             #instance attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Instance attributes refer to the attributes inside the constructor method, i.e., self.name and self.color. And Class attributes refer to the attributes outside the constructor method, i.e., car_type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve added the properties of the car. \n",
    "\n",
    " Methods are the functions we use to describe the behavior of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also defined inside a class.\n"
